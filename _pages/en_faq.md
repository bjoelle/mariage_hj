*How to dress ?*

We don't have any special requirements, though we would appreciate if you looked good ! Please also avoid green (as well as white, obviously) dresses.

*Is there a wedding list ?*

The only thing we truly need is your presence ! However if you would like to send a gift you can do so at this [address](https://www.milirose.com/liste-cadeaux-359607.html). *NB:* the process is in two steps, first pick a gift you like, then add the gift amount directly to the money pot. Thanks ! 

*And what about Covid ?*

We will provide hydroalcoholic gel, and you are of course welcome to wear a mask if you prefer. As a precaution we ask that all guests test themselves before coming to the party. Thanks in advance !
